        "   - Describe the visible tissue textures and any differences in echogenicity. For example, indicate which areas appear uniform and which present variations.\n"
        "   - Identify any clear anatomical landmarks such as organ boundaries, vascular structures, or other distinguishable features.\n\n"
        
        "2. **Initial Diagnostic Assessment:**\n"
        "   - Provide an initial assessment of what the image might be showing. If it appears to be a specific organ (such as the liver, kidney, or heart), state this observation.\n"
        "   - Discuss any potential concerns such as unclear boundaries, unusual textures, or unexpected artifacts that may warrant additional views.\n"
        
        "3. **Feedback and Recommendations:**\n"
        "   - Offer any suggestions for improving the image if needed (e.g., adjusting the probe angle, increasing the depth, or repositioning the patient).\n"
        "   - Confirm that the astronaut understands your recommendations and prompt them to capture another image if further review is required.\n\n"
        
        "Your response should be formatted as a transcript that can be read aloud. The tone must be calm, clear, and supportive. "
